      <br />

        <div class="container-fluid" id="storyBody0">
          <p>Silence greeted Earl as he woke, like it had every day for the past seven years. Neither an alarm nor light from a window woke him. Instead, pain in his back pushed the sleep out of his eyes. Scowling, he crab walked to the edge of his nest on the kitchen island.</p>
          <p>He stretched, then stepped down onto the frozen sea of belongings that covered his floor. Preserved peaches and ‘Travel’ journals bobbed on silent troughs and peaks. Plastic wrappers splashed under his footsteps as he approached an empty can of peach tea – <span id="nameReplace">Ellie</span>’s favorite.</p>
          <p>“Good morning.” He said.</p>
          <p>A thin halo of empty space surrounded the empty bottle.</p>
          <p>“You know, I thought that box pushing into my stomach this morning was you,” his scowl softened. “I tried to keep pretending, but my back doesn’t like twisting up to fit on our island.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Kubi opened a window covered by a newspaper. Mushy boxes of mint tea allowed the window only a centimeter of movement.</p>
          <p>Light stabbed at his eyes. Sun and street noise invaded his apartment through the small slit. A passing couple’s laughter exploded in his face. He wrapped his meaty fingers around the window handle and twisted it shut, strangling the laughter.</p>
          <p>His hoarse panting calmed back into his normal shallow wheezing.</p>
          <p>“I’ll try airing things out tomorrow when there’s less going on.”</p>
          <p>Choked laughter from the sidewalk outside continued to seep in.</p>
          <p>They all sounded so happy. Those people outside.</p>
          <p>”Maybe I should clean up. Go out like we used to!” Mr. Kubi said while walking back to the can of empty peach tea on the kitchen counter. “I mean I’ve been talking to this can like it’s you since,” he paused, and held the can in his hand. “Since well, you know.”</p>
	        <p><em>It’s just a can.</em> He tried to think.<em> I’ll start small. Throwing away a can can’t be that hard</em></p>
          <!--<p>Here is a <span id="nameReplace">Sam</span> I would like to replace</p>-->
          <button onclick="choice1()" type="button" class="btn-warning btn-lg" id="tossIt">toss it?</button>
        </div>

        <div id="storyBody2">
          <p><em>Yes,</em> it was just a can. Trash. Something to be thrown away. Mr. Kubi looked around for his garbage bin. Had he walked over to where the fridge disappeared into a mound of unread newspapers, and then dug at least one meter, he would have found it.</p>
	         <p>”Trash bags. I’ll need trash bags if I want to start cleaning up.” Mr. Kubi said.</p>
           <p>He waded to where his laptop floated on a wave of takeout boxes. The power cable disappeared into the depths and anchored it in its place like a buoy. Crusted green muck on both laptop halves made a <span id=grossSound>‘shlorp’</span> sound when peeled apart. Inside, a thick slimy film dulled the screen’s blue glow. The keys, unreadable.</p>
           <p>Mr. Kubi clicked on the internet icon. While waiting for it to load, he dipped his hands into the swell of boxes and paddled through them. Under the surface they came across something smooth like an algae covered river rock. He wiggled the object free, then pulled it up. The mass he held was once a book. What wasn’t already eroded away by mold felt sponge like.</p>
           <p>After reading what was left of the title, “. . . Eat . . . Spain,” he flipped through chunks of fused together pages. Between two sections he found a single frame comic captioned, “Cow Tools.”</p>
           <p>“I never understood his work.” He smiled then flipped the comic over to read the note on the back.</p>
           <p>“You’re thinking about it too hard!” As he read, he ran his fingers over the blue handwritten words. “I’ll explain it once I get back. Can’t wait to see you again soon!”</p>
           <p>Mr. Kubi gave the comic a kiss before letting it fall. Another drop in the ocean.</p>
           <p>Before ordering trash bags, he checked his email. Mr. Kubi never received anything but spam, though that didn’t stop him from checking often. Sometimes he responded to the junk mail; they never wrote back.</p>
           <p>He cheered when he saw his son’s email. Wide eyed and grinning, he immediately opened the message and read:</p>
           <p>Dad,</p>
           <p>The landlord called. Your neighbors moved out because of the smell coming from your room. He’s threatening eviction. I’m sending a crew to help you because apparently you still can’t be trusted to do it on your own. They’ll be there in a month. Don’t worry, they’re professionals who are trained for cases like you. If things go well, maybe we can return to normal. If not, I’ll have to cut all ties with you including financial. I can’t keep enabling you.</p>
           <p>Arnold.</p>
           <p>“What smell?” Mr. Kubi slammed the reply button. There’s no smell. I live here, I’d notice if things smelled.”</p>
           <p>Any happiness Mr. Kubi had felt was gone. In a furry, he wrote every hateful thing he had thought about himself, his son, and all those who he felt had abandoned him so many years ago.</p>

          <p><em>No,</em> it was best to hold onto <span id="nameReplace">Ellie.</span> Or at least what was left.</p>
          <p>Mr. Kubi put the empty can back in its place and then waded to where his laptop floated on a wave of takeout boxes.

        <div id="storyBody3">
          <p><strong><span id=angry>“Blocked?”</span></strong> He threw the book that rested next to him. It skipped across the still waves once, twice, then splattered on the wall. He sloshed to the peach tea on the counter and sank to his knees.</p>
          <p>“<span id=”nameReplace”>Ellie</span>, they’re coming to take you away from me.”</p>
          <p>A roaches footsteps pitter-pattered nearby.</p>
          <p>“No, I won’t let them.” he shook his head. “If email doesn’t work, then I’ll call him.”</p>
          <p>He swam through the sunken ruins of his past to his bedroom. Or at least to where he last remembered seeing the bedroom door, behind which was his phone. Two trunks made of stacks of ‘The Sun’ magazine grew like pumpkin ash out of the flood that blocked the doorway. He dove in head first and propelled himself through the tide one memory at a time.</p>
          <p>A wool scarf, striped like a lionfish, swam below the surface. He remembered watching his wife knit it. Warmth bubbled in him. The same warmth as when she wrapped the scarf around his neck. A loose thread caught and the scarf unraveled when he pulled it close. Teary eyed he followed the thread to where it was stuck on a rotten drawing guide.</p>
          <p>Inside laid one of <span id=”nameReplace”>Ellie</span>’s first drawn self-portraits, once ripped apart, then taped back together. He laid the book down gently before continuing his dive.</p>
          <p>After a few more strokes, Mr. Kubi found a bag of hair. He recognized the, once blonde now green, hair. Arnold’s first haircut. Mr. Kubi’s wife and he cut one half of his head. Her half, cut neatly, only emphasized his incompetence. The memory made him laugh and he looked around for the photos they had taken.</p>
          <p>Instead, his hands found a Death Valley National Park postcard. Shaking, he read the note written on the back. Blue, and handwritten.</p>
          <p>Hey you,</p>
          <p> I’m almost done leading this group. And that means I’ll be home to see you soon! I should be back in time for the peach harvest. The things I’d do for a real peach right now. I’ve been living on the canned stuff. It’s almost as bad as that artificial flavored tea you bought. Pity how short the season is, but I suppose that’s something to look forward too. Have you reserved spots for the orchard tour yet?</p>
          <p>Yours,</p>
          <p><span id=”nameReplace”>Ellie</span></p>
          <p>“That can’t be right?” Confusion poured into his lungs. Each of his violent exhales pushed the walls of his sunken cavern further from him until he choked on the void itself. The cavern walls trembled dangerously.</p>
          <p><em>She must have mis-wrote that.</em> Mr. Kubi thought.<em>Surely there's another letter around here somewhere</em></p>
