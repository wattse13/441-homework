      <h2>Mr. Kubi</h2>
        <div class="container-fluid" id="storyBody0">
          <p>Silence greeted Earl as he woke, like it had every day for the past seven years. Neither an alarm nor light from a window woke him. Instead, pain in his back pushed the sleep out of his eyes. Scowling, he crab walked to the edge of his nest on the kitchen island.</p>
          <p>He stretched, then stepped down onto the frozen sea of belongings that covered his floor. Preserved peaches and ‘Travel’ journals bobbed on silent troughs and peaks. Plastic wrappers splashed under his footsteps as he approached a peach tea on the kitchen counter.</p>
          <p>“Good morning.” He said.</p>
          <p>A thin halo of empty space surrounded the empty bottle.</p>
          <p>“You know, I thought that box pushing into my stomach this morning was you,” his scowl softened. “I tried to keep pretending, but my back doesn’t like twisting up to fit on our island.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Kubi opened a window covered by a newspaper. Mushy boxes of mint tea allowed the window only a centimeter of movement.</p>
          <p>Light stabbed at his eyes. Sun and street noise invaded his apartment through the small slit. A passing couple’s laughter exploded in his face. He wrapped his meaty fingers around the window handle and twisted it shut, strangling the laughter.</p>
          <p>His hoarse panting calmed back into his normal shallow wheezing.</p>
          <p>“I’ll try airing things out tomorrow when there’s less going on.”</p>
          <p>Choked laughter from the sidewalk outside continued to seep in.</p>
